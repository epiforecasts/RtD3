Create interactive visualisations of Rt estimates using D3.js ([Gibbs et al. (2020)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4011842)). Developed primarily targeting Rt estimates generated by the EpiNow2 package, RtD3 aims to make simple, beautiful visualisations that help researchers explore their results and share them with others.`RtD3` provides an interface for the JavaScript library [rt_vis](https://github.com/hamishgibbs/rt_vis/).

## Installation

Install from CRAN with: 

```r
install.packages("RtD3")
```

Install the stable development version of the package from our 
[r-universe](https://epiforecasts.r-universe.dev):

``` r
install.packages(
  "RtD3",
  repos = c(ropensci = 'https://epiforecasts.r-universe.dev',
            CRAN = 'https://cloud.r-project.org')
)
```

Or from Github:

``` r
remotes::install_github("epiforecasts/RtD3")
```

## Quickstart
Spatial data is passed to RtD3 as an `sf` object. Use the `rnaturalearth` package for quick access to global and national spatial data.

Rt estimates are available from [epiforecasts](https://epiforecasts.io/covid/) [covid-rt-estimates](https://github.com/epiforecasts/covid-rt-estimates/) in the format expected by this package. Use the helper function `readInEpiNow2` to generate the summary widget with existing estimates.

``` r
geoData = rnaturalearth::ne_countries(returnclass = 'sf')

rtData <- list("Cases" = readInEpiNow2(
    path = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/epiforecasts/covid-rt-estimates/master/national/cases/summary",
    region_var = "country"))

summaryWidget(geoData = geoData, rtData = rtData)
```
